# Overview

This project, **Python Task Manager**, is designed to enhance task management solutions. The software enables users to manage their tasks effectively through features such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks. It also incorporates persistent storage, filtering, and sorting functionality. 

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of Python programming, practice working with file I/O, and learn to structure a Python application using modular functions and libraries. This project also introduced me to the `tabulate` library for formatting output in a user-friendly way.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of this task manager by:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt for a better user experience.
- Implementing task notifications for due dates.
- Enabling data export to formats like CSV or Excel.
- Adding more advanced analytics features, such as task completion trends.
